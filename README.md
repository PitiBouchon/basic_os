# BasicOs

A basic riscv os just in Rust 

Inspirations from [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), [rrxv6](https://github.com/yodalee/rrxv6), [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com) and [vanadinite](https://github.com/repnop/vanadinite)

## Dependencies

In order to build and run the os you'll need :
- ðŸ¦€ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) which you can install via `cargo install --force cargo-make`
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/) for Riscv
- *(for linux, if you want to use gdb on your machine)* The Newlib cross-compiler of [Riscv-GNU-Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain)

## Build & Run

You can use the usual commands `cargo build` and `cargo run` to run the OS with QEMU

> `cargo run` just does `cargo make qemu` (see `.cargo/config.toml`) which is described in the `Makefile.toml`

### Target
To setup the target just change the target in the `.cargo/config.toml`
```toml
[build]
target = "riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf"
```

## Debugging with gdb

Run in a terminal `cargo make qemu-gdb`
And in another terminal (in this directory) `riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb`
